# Week 7 

This folder contains my C++ program for finding the largest of three numbers. The code asks user for 3 numbers and uses nested if statements to see which is the largest. It starts by comparing the first two numbers then compares the bigger of the first 2 number to the third number to find the biggest number. After seeing which is the biggest, it prints out the biggest. 
The module focused on understanding different programming errors and learning debugging using conditional logic, logical operatorand nested if statements.
