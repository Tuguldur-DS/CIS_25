Week 6

This program creates a list of 100 items using a struct that stores a name and an ID. The list uses dynamic memory (new) and fills the items with names Item_1 through Item_100, with IDs from 100 to 199. The user enters an ID, and the program uses binary search to find it. The program prints the item if found, or says it wasn’t found. Finally, it frees the memory with delete[].
