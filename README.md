# Week 5 Homework

This week's assignment uses strings, classes, and file I/O.
The program creates an Item class with two properties:
- name (string)
- quantity (int)
The class includes:
- saveToFile(): writes the item data to item
- loadFromFile(): reads the file from item

In main(), an Item object is created, assigned values, saved to the file, and then read back and displayed.
