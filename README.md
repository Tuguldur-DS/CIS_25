# Week 6
This program creates a list of 100 items using a struct that stores a name and an ID. The list is made with dynamic memory (new) and filled with items named Item_1 through Item_100, with IDs from 100 to 199.

The user enters an ID, and the program uses binary search to find the matching item. If the ID exists, it prints the item’s name and ID. If not, it tells the user it wasn’t found. The program finishes by freeing the memory with delete[].
